# 📊 Descriptive Statistics Case Study

This project analyzes a dataset of 50 employees to explore how age, health habits, and salary correlate using basic **descriptive statistics** and **data visualizations**. It is built as part of my internship learning tasks and showcases foundational analysis skills using **Python**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.

## 📁 Dataset Features

| Column Name         | Description                                 |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `id`                | Unique employee ID                          |
| `groups`            | Categorical group the employee belongs to   |
| `age`               | Employee age (integer)                      |
| `healthy_eating`    | Health rating based on eating habits (1–10) |
| `active_lifestyle`  | Rating for physical activity (1–10)         |
| `salary`            | Employee salary (numeric)                   |

## 📌 Objectives

- Load and understand the dataset
- Visualize relationships between age, health, and salary
- Use histograms, scatter plots, and count plots
- Subset the data using custom thresholds
- Extract key business insights from patterns and anomalies

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- A general **positive correlation** exists between `age` and `salary`.
- Employees with higher `healthy_eating` scores often earn more — but not always.
- Some outliers were identified (e.g., employee with high health scores but low salary).
- **Group A** had the highest employee count in the dataset.

---

## 📊 Visualizations Included

- Scatter Plot: Age vs Salary  
- Scatter Plot: Healthy Eating vs Salary  
- Scatter Plot: Healthy Eating vs Active Lifestyle  
- Count Plot: Group frequency  
- Histogram: Salary distribution  

---

## ✂️ Data Subsetting Tasks

- Employees with `healthy_eating > 8`
- Employees with `salary < 1000`
- Employees satisfying both conditions

Key observation: Employee with `id = 26` showed a **salary-health mismatch**.
